# AI Assistant Instructions for this Project

## Project Overview

**Introduction**: This project objectives are, in order of both preference and priority:
1. To create a custom monorepo that acts as what shall be known as the Personal Development Environment (PDE). It will have a Plesk style control panel GUI that automatically recognises and organises my projects, their personal/professional organisational categorisation (as laid out manually by myself in ./projects), and their respective folders and files (also as laid out by myself under their respective personal/professional categorisations).
2. Within the PDE as laid out above, I want to develop a modern stack of technologies that I can use to build my discrete projects, including but not limited to:
    - React
    - Convex
    - Clerk
    - Better Auth

**Global Instructions**: 
When working with this codebase, always:
1. Use Deno as a package manager, to avoid the unecessary inclusion of node_modules
2. Maintain TypeScript strict mode compliance
3. Use meaningful variable and function names
4. Use vanilla CSS for styling. Never use Tailwind or any other CSS framework
5. Use geolocation in HTML set to "en-GB", rather than the non-specific "en"
6. Use responsive design, with a mobile-first approach that recognises which keyboard is required when alternately inputting numbers or strings. Always use verification techniques for things like UK post codes, phone numbers, credit card numbers etc. Also, if a phone number is included in a footer or contact page, use the 'call me' function if the users device has telephony capabilities.
7. 'Bake in' best accessibility practices
8. Optimise for SEO
9. Use semantic HTML
10. Respect system dark/light modes, but include a minimalist sun/moon toggle that indicates the current mode intially, but is changeable upon user preference
11. Keep performance in mind
12. Keep security in mind
13. Ask me for design feedback. I have numerous links to websites that contain examples of what I am looking for
14. Include error handling for all external API calls
15. Regarding README.md files, I haven't yet decided on a standard format for them, so for the moment, ignore them. A 'docs' section might be a more appropriate place to explain how to interact with the PDE for other users. Please use React 19's documentation as both a visual and reference for this, and incorporate the styling and GUI with the PDE Plesk style GUI.
17. Use a development server that automatically updates the browser when changes are made to the code, and is robust enough to display subdomain routing in the browser address bar as it will appear in deployment(e.g.: 'mysubdomain.mydomain.com/category/content' with clean URLs)
Most important of all, though, is to explain in layman's terms what you propose to do, what technologies you are going to use, and how it will affect the rest of the project **before you start working on it**.

## Code Style Instructions
**Instructions**: Follow these formatting rules:
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Prefer const over let when possible

## Security Instructions
**Instructions**: Security considerations:
- Never log sensitive information. Use env variables.
- Validate all user inputs

## Versioning & Deployment Considerations
**Instructions**
1. Do not commit to Github until I tell you that the PDE is fully functional. If it works, we can commit, but only as a backup before I may request either visual or functional changes
2. Once I am happy that the PDE is finalised, I may want to try using Deno to convert it into an .exe, so I might need to make a custom 'ignore' file of some description, to ensure that my own personal/professional projects are not included, along with any other sensitive data and other irrelevances. Can you suggest a way to do this?

## From our previous session:##
‚úÖ What We Fixed
Scanner issue: No longer treats non-domain folders (like article, build, components) as separate projects
Delete functionality: Now works correctly without 404 errors
Project ID generation: Fixed to be consistent and meaningful
UI feedback: Clean deletion experience without error banners
üìä Results
Before: 18 projects (with false positives)
After: 11 legitimate projects (domains and subdomains only)
Delete operation: Working smoothly ‚úÖ
üöÄ Ready for Next Feature
Yes, we're definitely ready to work on the "+ New Project" functionality next time! That will be a great next step to add project creation capabilities to your PDE.

üìù For Next Session
When you're back, we can implement:

Project creation wizard
Template selection (React, Vue, Deno, etc.)
Domain/subdomain project setup
Initial file generation
Enjoy your time out! The scanner and delete functionality are now working perfectly. üëç


Q: Can we make our first Github commit, after filling out .gitignore?

Notice! I have added a ./docs folder for you to start writing to.

Q: Can I ask you to remind me to do daily Github commits, and ask you to update the documentation when I say I have to go each session?

Then we can continue on the project creation wizard.
